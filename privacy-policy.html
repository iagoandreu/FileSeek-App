        <h1>Privacy Policy for FileSeek</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 1, 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Iago Andreu ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in the FileSeek application (the "App"). Our commitment is to protect your privacy.</p>

        <h3>1. No Personal Data Collection</h3>
        <p>FileSeek is designed to be a private and secure utility. The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information or personal data from you. We do not include any third-party analytics or advertising frameworks.</p>

        <h3>2. Your Files and API Key</h3>
        <p>All interactions with your files occur locally on your device. When you use the AI features, the relevant file data (such as filenames or content for semantic search indexing) is sent directly from your Mac to the Google AI API. This communication is secured by your personal API key.</p>
        <p>Your Google AI Studio API key is stored securely in your Mac's local Keychain. It is never transmitted to us or any other third party.</p>

        <h3>3. Data You Create (Organization Plans & Search Indexes)</h3>
        <p>All data generated during the use of the App, such as proposed organization plans and the semantic search index, is stored exclusively and locally on your device. This data is sandboxed within the App's private storage and is not accessible by us.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Your Control Over Your Data</h3>
        <p>Because all data is stored locally, you have complete control. You can delete your data at any time by deleting the App from your device.</p>

        <h3>5. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone. Since the App does not collect any personal information, it is safe for users of all ages.</p>

        <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us:</p>
