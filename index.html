                <h2>What is FileSeek?</h2>
                <p>
                    FileSeek is a native macOS application designed to solve a common problem: messy, unorganized folders. Using the power of the Google AI platform (Gemini models), FileSeek analyzes the files in any folder—based on their names, formats, and content—and proposes a clean, logical folder structure. With one click, your chaos is organized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, FileSeek revolutionizes how you find your files. Instead of guessing keywords, you can perform a <strong>semantic search</strong>. Simply describe the document you are looking for (e.g., <code>"the financial report from last quarter"</code> or <code>"a presentation about marketing performance"</code>), and FileSeek will find the most relevant files, even if the exact words aren't in the title.
