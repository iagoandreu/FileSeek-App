        <p>
            A messy folder is more than just clutter. It’s a tax on your attention. Every moment spent searching for a file is a moment not spent on the work that matters. The modern computer gives us infinite storage but offers primitive tools to manage it, forcing our brains to act like a biological filing cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
            We think that's a flawed design. Your Mac should be a partner in your work, not a librarian you have to constantly manage. FileSeek is a native macOS utility built on this principle. It offloads the low-value work of tidying and remembering, so you can reclaim your focus.

            <h2>Stop Managing Files. Start Creating.</h2>
            <p>
                Your computer presents you with a choice: spend the next 20 minutes dragging files into folders, or make <strong>one decision</strong> and get back to your actual work. FileSeek's AI analyzes the chaos and presents a perfect plan. Your only job is to approve it. It's the most productive click you'll make all day.

            <h2>Why is a search bar a memory test?</h2>
            <p>
                You remember the document was "about the Q3 financial forecast," but you can't remember if you named it 'Report.pdf'. Traditional search demands you know the exact keyword. FileSeek bridges this gap. Describe what you remember, and its <strong>semantic search</strong> finds what you <strong>meant</strong>, not just what you typed.
