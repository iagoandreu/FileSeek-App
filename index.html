        </header>

        <p>
            A messy folder is more than just clutter. It’s a tax on your attention. Every moment spent searching for a file is a moment not spent on the work that matters. The modern computer gives us infinite storage but offers primitive tools to manage it, forcing our brains to act like a biological filing cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
            We think that's a flawed design. Your Mac should be a partner in your work, not a librarian you have to constantly manage. FileSeek is a native macOS utility built on this principle. It offloads the low-value work of tidying and remembering, so you can reclaim your focus.
        </p>

        <h2>Most organizers make you tidy. FileSeek lets you think.</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of forcing you to manually drag, drop, and rename files—a chore that fragments your focus—FileSeek acts as your intelligent digital butler. Point it at any folder, and its AI analyzes everything—filenames, content, and file types—to understand what your files *are*.
        </p>
        <p>
            It then proposes a clean, logical folder structure for your approval. With a single click, the chaos is organized. Hours of digital housekeeping are completed in seconds, letting you get back to a state of flow.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is a search bar a memory test?</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional search is fundamentally broken. It requires you to remember the exact keyword you used when you saved a file weeks, months, or years ago. Did you name it `Q3_Marketing_Report_v2_Final.pdf` or `Marketing_Results_Q3.pdf`? Guessing wrong means the file stays lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            FileSeek replaces this guessing game with **semantic search**. It lets you find what you *meant*, not just what you typed. You can describe the document in natural language: <em>"the presentation about the new logo design from last summer"</em> or <em>"the invoice from that client in Barcelona."</em> The AI understands the context and finds the most relevant files, even if your search terms don't appear anywhere in the filename.
        </p>
